<h1 align="center">02. Deploying the API</h1>

**ðŸ’¡ Hint:** We recommend following guides for local development and updates through the original [repository][link-to-repo] to avoid potential misconfiguration.

Our API allows the frontend to interact with and view what's been uploaded and sent through the pipeline deployed in the previous step. It gives access to what units and sessions are currently available to view, update and maintain metadata associated to these sessions, and more.

> \[!NOTE]
>
> If you are unfamiliar with the installation process of the AWS CLI, you can get started with the prerequisites by following the steps [here][back-to-prerequisites]

## Clone the repository

_Before starting the deployment, clone the [ARRAT API repository](https://github.com/arrat-tools/api) to your local machine._

## Deploying to AWS

First, navigate into the API repository before running then the deployment commands

```bash
cd api/tac-session-manager-api/ # Directory where deployment templates are.
```

  </picture>

</div>

_If needed, update `arrat-cli` to the profile configured during the prerequisites step_

Follow the guided deployment instructions and configure you SAM deployment based the infrastructure set up in the previous step:

<b>Setting default arguments for 'sam deploy'</b>

- `Stack Name`: The CloudFormation stack to deploy the template to _(Default - tac-sessionmanager-api)_
- `AWS Region`: The region to deploy the stack to _(Default - us-east-1)_
- `Parameter StageName`: Unique environment for deployment set to `prod`, `stage`, `test`, or `dev` _(Default - dev)_
- `Parameter UnitsS3Bucket`: S3 Bucket where all synced units from the vehicle are uploaded to. Should match the `SessionInputBucketName` from the Outputs when deploying the infrastructure.
- `Parameter UnitsFolderName`: _Optional_ subfolder where all units are uploaded _(Default - '')_
- `Parameter SessionsS3Bucket`: S3 Bucket where all created sessions are uploaded to. Should match the `SessionOutputBucketName` from the Outputs when deploying the infrastructure.
- `Parameter SessionsFolderName`: _Optional_ subfolder where all sessions are uploaded _(Default - '')_
- `Parameter StateMachineRunPipelineName`: AWS StateMachine StepFunction to trigger when creating new sessions. Should match the `ARRATStateMachineName` from the Outputs when deploying the infrastructure. _(Default - 'SSM-runscript')_

Continue answering the rest of the prompts and answer `y` when asked 'Deploy this changeset? [y/N]'

> \[!IMPORTANT]
>
> Remember to answer **'y'** when prompted '\<Function\> has no authentication. Is this okay? [y/N]'

## Deployment output

Once deployed, a list of output values will be shown. Save the `WebEndpoint` for a later step. This value will be used for the `SERVER_SESSION_API_BASE_URL` environment variable when deploying the front-end.

  </picture>

</div>

_If needed, this value can also be found under the outputs tab underneath the deployed CloudFormation Stack (matching the name set in the previous step) within the AWS Console._
